# Pizzeria website(The Kingdom)

## What about this project?
This is a simple website, created with *HTML*, *CSS* and *JavaScript*. Moreover, I used images from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) and from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/it/). It is also responsive, and the fonts are from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

There are many section into it, where you can find an animated burger-menu, the about section, the products section, the services section and the contact section.

## What about css animation?
I used the *@keyframes* animations to make the project more pleasant.
